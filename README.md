# project-oldagram
It is a mini project, trying to mimic the UI of popular social media platform Instagram.
The main screen of the Oldagram app is called the "feed." This is where users can see a continuous stream of photos and videos from people they follow. Users can scroll through their feed to see new content, and they can also like, comment on, or share posts from their feed.
